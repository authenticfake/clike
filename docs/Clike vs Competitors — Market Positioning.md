# Clike vs Competitors — Market Positioning

## Distinctive Value
- **SPEC → PLAN → KIT**: structured pipeline aligned with Harper’s Hero’s Journey
- **Eval-Driven Development**: mandatory lint/type/test gates before deployment
- **MCP & RAG Native**: interoperability, grounding, and provider neutrality
- **Enterprise Auditability**: full audit trail (runs/, manifests, CI integration)

## Competitor Landscape
- **Cursor / Windsurf**: IDE-first, rapid adoption, $100M+ ARR, but limited governance & audit
- **GitHub Copilot**: mainstream, MS ecosystem, excellent adoption, but shallow governance and workflow support

## Positioning Strategy
- **Not another IDE** — instead a **framework for enterprises**
- Focus on **compliance, governance, auditability, and orchestration**
- Appeal to organizations requiring **safe AI-native pipelines**

## Risks
- Early-stage, must differentiate clearly
- Competing against well-funded, mass-market IDE players
