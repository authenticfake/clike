# GOVERNANCE â€” Eval-Driven Development & TRiSM

## Policies
- Strict: evals must pass; merges blocked.
- Advisory: allow override with reason (audited).

## Evals
- Lint, Unit, SAST/DAST, UAT, RAG metrics.

## Audit
- `audit_id` and `runs/<timestamp>_audit_id` with requests/responses/diffs/evals/sources.
