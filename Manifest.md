# 🚀 CLike: Vibe Coding for Enterprise

## 🌟 Vision
CLike is born to reshape software development in the **AI-native era**.  
It is not just another coding assistant, but a **differentiated platform** that merges:

- **Harper-style approach** → SPEC → PLAN → KIT, short iterations, eval-driven, integrated with RAG & MCP.  
- **Vibe Coding (Gartner/Karpathy)** → outcome- and intent-focused, developer in flow state, bug fixing and refactoring handled by AI.  
- **AI-Native Software Engineering** → agentic workflows, eval-driven governance, multimodality, and TRiSM.  

👉 The goal: **accelerate innovation and prototyping**, keep developers in a deep *flow state*, while ensuring **quality, security, and governance**.

## 🔑 Core Principles
1. **SPEC → PLAN → KIT**  
   Every project is structured into short, verifiable steps.  
   - IDEA: the idea overview with technology and business constraints.  
   - SPEC: a clear, shared definition of the problem and for the solution.  
   - PLAN: execution roadmap with tasks, risks, and evals.  
   - KIT: executable, validated, and versionable artifacts.  

2. **Eval-Driven Development (EDD)**  
   Every generation is validated with **automated evals** (unit tests, linting, SAST/DAST, UAT).  
   Quality is embedded in the process, not an afterthought.  

3. **AI-Native Workflow**  
   - **RAG** → grounding on enterprise documents, libraries, and context.  
   - **MCP** → a standard protocol to integrate tools and data.  
   - **Agentic orchestration** → AI agents that execute, verify, and self-correct.  

4. **Developer as Orchestrator**  
   Developers are not replaced: they guide the process, make product decisions, and keep the strategic vision.  
   AI takes care of drudgery, refactoring, bug fixing, and tests.  

5. **Flow State & Outcome Focused**  
   Generated code is not the end goal.  
   CLike delivers **concrete outcomes**, keeping developers in a creative flow without distractions.

## 🛠️ Architecture
- **Python AI-Native Backend**: SPEC/PLAN/KIT orchestration, RAG, MCP, eval engine.  
- **VS Code Extension**: integrated UI (SPEC tab, PLAN tab, KIT tab, Eval Panel, Chat).  
- **Governance Layer**: audit trail, reproducibility, TRiSM compliance.  
- **Secure Sandbox**: kits are generated and executed in isolated environments.  

---

## ✨ Differentiation
- **Harper Guardrails** → no progression without coherent SPEC/PLAN.  
- **One-click reproducibility** → every run outputs complete and traceable artifacts.  
- **Model Router** → YAML configuration to balance cost vs. quality.  
- **Innovation-first, Governance-ready** → creative freedom on a safe, paved road.  

---

## 📌 Why CLike
- For **developers** → a companion that removes repetitive work and boosts creativity.  
- For **enterprises** → a safe platform to adopt Vibe Coding with built-in governance and TRiSM.  
- For **managers** → outcome-driven metrics, not just lines of code.
