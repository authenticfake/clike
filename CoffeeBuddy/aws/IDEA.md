# IDEA â€” CoffeeBuddy

## Vision
CoffeeBuddy is a Slack mini-app that organizes office coffee runs: teammates submit orders via Slack, one person (the runner) is assigned automatically, reminders are sent, and preferences are remembered.

## Problem Statement
Teams waste time coordinating coffee orders in ad-hoc threads. Orders are lost, someone forgets, and preferences are not tracked. CoffeeBuddy standardizes the flow inside Slack and reduces coordination time.

## Target Users & Context
- Primary: office teammates who want to place and pick up coffee orders.
- Secondary: office managers who care about fairness and time savings.
- Context: Slack workspace; lightweight serverless backend; mobile-friendly interactions.

## Value & Outcomes
- Faster coordination (<2 minutes per coffee run).
- Fewer errors (consistent order summaries).
- Fair runner assignment across the team.

## Out of Scope
Payments, delivery logistics, vendor integrations beyond Slack interactions.

## Risks & Assumptions

Assumption: Slack workspace admin can install apps.

Risk: Rate limits on Slack events; mitigated via queue buffering.

## Success Metrics (early)

Weekly active coffee runs per active user.

Time from first command to order confirmation.

## Sources & Inspiration

Slack platform patterns and internal team feedback sessions.
